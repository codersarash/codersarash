 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @codersarash

I am a full-stack software engineer and writer. I love programming, reading, writing and speaking.

As a software engineer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, and my unequivocal love for making things that change the world.

That's why I like to make things that make a difference.
